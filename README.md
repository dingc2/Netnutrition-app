# Netnutrition-app

This repo is for the development of the NetNutrition app that will obtain data
from the Department of Dining's server or by scraping the website but with
more customizable preferences in order to provide the most solid experience
possible. This will include the delivery of menus, dining hall hours, how busy
those dining halls are, dietary/allergy restriction, among other features.

For the framework we will be using the following components as listed.
Javascript will be used for the programming language due to its capacity for
usage with React Native for cross-platform development. The frontend framework
will be React Native as stated, due to its robust third party library support,
built in UI components for frontend development, and for the same set of code
to be applied to both Android and iOS. Amazon Web Services will be utilized as
a database to host the backend while Github will be utilized for coordination
on the project code through commits and pushes. Trello will also be used to 
communicate the progress of tasks. Node.js will be utilized for the backend as
it allows for Javascript usage on both teh client and server sides, allows high
performance and scalability for mobile apps, and handles API requests from the
frontend, user authentication, and communicates with the database.
